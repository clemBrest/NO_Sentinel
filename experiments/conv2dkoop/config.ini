model_name = LinConv

# Model parameters
# P and Q shape are the shapes of encoder and decoder MLPs
# conv is the type of convolution to use
# n_modes is the number of modes in the model for fourier convolution
# for multiwavelet convolution, n_modes is not used, and the levels of the wavelet are given in the conv parameter as: conv = wavelet_1
# no_skip is the type of skip connection to use
# n_ino is the number of loops in the INO block
